# Serverless Framework Node Express API on AWS

This template demonstrates how to develop and deploy a simple Node Express API service, backed by DynamoDB table, running on AWS Lambda using the Serverless Framework.

## Usage

### Deployment

Install dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

and then deploy with:

```
serverless deploy
```

After running deploy, you should see output similar to:

```
Deploying "aws-node-express-dynamodb-api" to stage "dev" (us-east-1)

âœ” Service deployed to stack aws-node-express-dynamodb-api-dev (109s)

endpoint: ANY - https://xxxxxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
functions:
  api: aws-node-express-dynamodb-api-dev-api (3.8 MB)
```

_Note_: In current form, after deployment, your API is public and can be invoked by anyone. For production deployments, you might want to configure an authorizer. For details on how to do that, refer to [`httpApi` event docs](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/http-api/). Additionally, in current configuration, the DynamoDB table will be removed when running `serverless remove`. To retain the DynamoDB table even after removal of the stack, add `DeletionPolicy: Retain` to its resource definition.

### Invocation

After successful deployment, you can create a new card by calling the corresponding endpoint:

```
curl --request POST 'https://xxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/cards' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw '{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "position": "Serverless Developer",
    "image": "https://example.com/avatar.jpg"
  }'
```

Which should result in the following response:

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "position": "Serverless Developer",
  "image": "https://example.com/avatar.jpg"
}
```

You can later retrieve the card by `cardId` by calling the following endpoint:

```
curl https://xxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/cards/someCardId
```

Which should result in the following response:

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "position": "Serverless Developer",
  "image": "https://example.com/avatar.jpg"
}
```

### Local development

The easiest way to develop and test your function is to use the `dev` command:

```
serverless dev
```

This will start a local emulator of AWS Lambda and tunnel your requests to and from AWS Lambda, allowing you to interact with your function as if it were running in the cloud.

Now you can invoke the function as before, but this time the function will be executed locally. Now you can develop your function locally, invoke it, and see the results immediately without having to re-deploy.

When you are done developing, don't forget to run `serverless deploy` to deploy the function to the cloud.
